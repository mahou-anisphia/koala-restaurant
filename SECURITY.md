### Best Practices for Security

To maintain the security of your instance of Koala Restaurant Management System, follow these best practices:

#### 1. Secure Environment Configuration

- Ensure that your `.env` file is not included in version control by adding it to `.gitignore`.
- Use strong, unique passwords for your database and AWS keys.
- Regularly rotate your AWS IAM keys and database passwords.

#### 2. Database Security

- Apply the latest security patches to your MySQL database.
- Restrict access to the database to only trusted IP addresses.
- Use secure connections (SSL/TLS) for database communications.

#### 3. Application Security

- Regularly update your dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` to identify and fix vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing stack traces and sensitive information.
- Use the `helmet` middleware to secure HTTP headers.

#### 4. Data Protection

- Ensure that all sensitive data, such as passwords and JWT tokens, are encrypted both in transit and at rest.
- Use the `bcrypt` library to hash passwords before storing them in the database.
- Validate and sanitize all input to prevent SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Dependency Management

This project uses several third-party dependencies. We recommend regularly checking for updates and applying them promptly to mitigate security risks.

### Monitoring and Logging

Implement monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents:

- Use logging tools to track access and error logs.
- Monitor for unusual activity and set up alerts for potential security breaches.
